# OSU_FEH_Robot
The was presented in the Fundamentals to Engineering: Robotics competition. It is an autonomous vehicle, powered by a FEH Proteus, that is programmed to complete certain tasks on a course that can be seen below. Some of the challenges during this project were re-calibrating the navigation of the robot due to mechanical errors and checking whether the robot was in the correct position using the OSU Robot Positioning System (RPS).
